# Bank-Loan-Prediction
The goal of this project is to create a simple web app which can be used as a first step to predict whether someone is eligible or not to get a loan. Using Machine Learning classification algorithms.
##In the Banking mechanism, to able to find out whether someone is eligible or not to get a loan is to analyse
 their several important variables such as: Credit history, Income, and Loan Amount. However, they often 
analyse customer document for a long time, which cause customers move to a Bank that has instant approval 
process. 

The goal of this project is to create a simple web app which can be used as a first step to predict whether
 someone is eligible or not to get a loan.

Predict the loan status of a customer who wants to apply for a credit loan by comparing 
3 Machine Learning Models: 1) Logistic Regression, 2) Random Forest Classifier, 3) Decision Tree Classifier.
